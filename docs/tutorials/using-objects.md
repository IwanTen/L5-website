# Using Objects

**Previous tutorial**: [Arrays (ordered tables)](arrays-tables.md)

You now know how to use arrays (ordered tables) to store multiple values. This tutorial introduces **objects**, which let you group related values together using named properties instead of their index number.

## The Problem with Multiple Arrays

In the previous tutorial, you used multiple arrays to store information about circles:

```lua
circleX = {100, 200, 150}
circleY = {100, 150, 200}
circleSpeedX = {2, -1, 1}
circleSpeedY = {1, 2, -2}
```

This approach is called **parallel arrays**. It works, but it has problems:

* It's hard to keep track of which index goes with which circle
* If you add or remove a circle, you have to update multiple arrays
* The relationships between the data aren't clear

## Objects

An **object** is a table that uses named properties instead of an index number. This is also called an **associative array** - instead of accessing values with numbers like `circleX[1]`, you can access them with names like `circle.x`.

To create an object in Lua, use curly brackets with **key-value pairs**. A key-value pair is a property name (the key) followed by `=` and then its value:

```lua
ball = {x = 100, y = 150, speedX = 2, speedY = 1}
```

This creates an object named `ball` with four properties: `x`, `y`, `speedX`, and `speedY`.

## Accessing Object Properties

You can access object properties using **dot notation**:

```lua
print(ball.x)       -- prints 100
print(ball.speedX)  -- prints 2
```

You can also use **bracket notation** with strings:

```lua
print(ball["x"])       -- prints 100
print(ball["speedX"])  -- prints 2
```

Dot notation is usually easier to read, but bracket notation is useful when the property name is in a variable.

## Modifying Object Properties

You can change object properties just like regular variables:

```lua
ball.x = ball.x + ball.speedX
ball.y = ball.y + ball.speedY
```

Here's a complete example:

![a ball bounces off the edges of the window](/assets/tutorials/animation4.gif)

```lua
require("L5")

ball = {x = 150, y = 150, speedX = 2, speedY = 1}

function setup()
  size(300, 300)
end

function draw()
  background(220)
  
  -- Move ball
  ball.x = ball.x + ball.speedX
  ball.y = ball.y + ball.speedY
  
  -- Bounce off edges
  if ball.x < 0 or ball.x > width then
    ball.speedX = ball.speedX * -1
  end
  if ball.y < 0 or ball.y > height then
    ball.speedY = ball.speedY * -1
  end
  
  -- Draw ball
  circle(ball.x, ball.y, 30)
end
```

This is much clearer than using separate variables for each property!

## Arrays of Objects

The real power of objects comes when you combine them with arrays. Instead of multiple parallel arrays, you can have one array of objects:

![3 circles bounce around the screen](/assets/tutorials/using-objects2.gif)

```lua
require("L5")

circles = {
  {x = 100, y = 100, speedX = 2, speedY = 1},
  {x = 200, y = 150, speedX = -1, speedY = 2},
  {x = 150, y = 200, speedX = 1, speedY = -2}
}

function setup()
  size(300, 300)
end

function draw()
  background(220)
  
  for i = 1, #circles do
    -- Move circle
    circles[i].x = circles[i].x + circles[i].speedX
    circles[i].y = circles[i].y + circles[i].speedY
    
    -- Bounce off edges
    if circles[i].x < 0 or circles[i].x > width then
      circles[i].speedX = circles[i].speedX * -1
    end
    if circles[i].y < 0 or circles[i].y > height then
      circles[i].speedY = circles[i].speedY * -1
    end
    
    -- Draw circle
    circle(circles[i].x, circles[i].y, 30)
  end
end
```

Now all the data for each circle is grouped together, making the code easier to understand and maintain!

## Creating Objects Dynamically

You can create new objects and add them to an array:

![many circles bouncing around the screen](/assets/tutorials/using-objects3.gif)

```lua
require("L5")

circles = {}

function setup()
  size(300, 300)
  
  -- Create 10 random circles
  for i = 1, 10 do
    newCircle = {
      x = random(width),
      y = random(height),
      speedX = random(-3, 3),
      speedY = random(-3, 3),
      size = random(10, 40)
    }
    table.insert(circles, newCircle)
  end
end

function draw()
  background(220)
  
  for i = 1, #circles do
    -- Move circle
    circles[i].x = circles[i].x + circles[i].speedX
    circles[i].y = circles[i].y + circles[i].speedY
    
    -- Bounce off edges
    if circles[i].x < 0 or circles[i].x > width then
      circles[i].speedX = circles[i].speedX * -1
    end
    if circles[i].y < 0 or circles[i].y > height then
      circles[i].speedY = circles[i].speedY * -1
    end
    
    -- Draw circle
    circle(circles[i].x, circles[i].y, circles[i].size)
  end
end
```

Each circle now has its own size too!

## Interactive Example: Click to Add

Here's an example where you can click to add new circles:

![clicking creates new colored circles that bounce around](/assets/tutorials/using-objects4.gif)

```lua
require("L5")

circles = {}

function setup()
  size(300, 300)
end

function draw()
  background(220)
  
  for i = 1, #circles do
    -- Move circle
    circles[i].x = circles[i].x + circles[i].speedX
    circles[i].y = circles[i].y + circles[i].speedY
    
    -- Bounce off edges
    if circles[i].x < 0 or circles[i].x > width then
      circles[i].speedX = circles[i].speedX * -1
    end
    if circles[i].y < 0 or circles[i].y > height then
      circles[i].speedY = circles[i].speedY * -1
    end
    
    -- Draw circle
    fill(circles[i].r, circles[i].g, circles[i].b)
    circle(circles[i].x, circles[i].y, circles[i].size)
  end
end

function mousePressed()
  newCircle = {
    x = mouseX,
    y = mouseY,
    speedX = random(-2, 2),
    speedY = random(-2, 2),
    size = random(20, 50),
    r = random(255),
    g = random(255),
    b = random(255)
  }
  table.insert(circles, newCircle)
end
```

Click anywhere to add a new bouncing circle with a random color and size!

## Example: Particles

Objects are perfect for particle systems:

![clicking produces particle systems of balls that move up the screen](/assets/tutorials/using-objects5.gif)

```lua
require("L5")

particles = {}

function setup()
  size(300, 300)
end

function draw()
  background(220, 220, 255)
  
  for i = #particles, 1, -1 do
    -- Update particle
    particles[i].y = particles[i].y + particles[i].speedY
    particles[i].life = particles[i].life - 1
    
    -- Draw particle
    fill(255, 255, 255, particles[i].life)
    circle(particles[i].x, particles[i].y, particles[i].size)
    
    -- Remove dead particles
    if particles[i].life <= 0 then
      table.remove(particles, i)
    end
  end
end

function mousePressed()
  -- Create burst of particles
  for i = 1, 20 do
    particle = {
      x = mouseX,
      y = mouseY,
      speedY = random(-5, -1),
      size = random(5, 15),
      life = 255
    }
    table.insert(particles, particle)
  end
end
```

Click to create a burst of particles that fade away! Notice we loop backwards (`#particles, 1, -1`) when removing items to avoid index problems.

## Objects vs Arrays: When to Use Each

Use **arrays** (ordered tables) when:
* You have a list of similar items
* Order matters
* You access items by position

Use **objects** when:
* You have related data that belongs together
* You want to access data by name, not number
* You're representing a "thing" with properties

Use **arrays of objects** when:
* You have multiple "things" with the same properties
* Each "thing" has several related values

## Practice

Congratulations! You've completed the L5 fundamentals tutorials! Here are some ideas to practice with objects:

* Create a simple game with player and enemy objects
* Build a starfield where each star is an object with position, size, and twinkle speed
* Make a drawing program where each stroke is stored as an object
* Create a simulation with objects that have different behaviors
* Build a simple physics engine with objects that have mass and velocity
* Make an interactive garden where each plant is an object that grows over time

## What's Next?

You now know the fundamentals of programming in L5! You can:

* Call functions and create your own
* Use variables and create your own
* Make decisions with if statements
