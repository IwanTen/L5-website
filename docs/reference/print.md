Displays text in the web browser's console.

`print()` is helpful for printing values while debugging. Each call to
`print()` creates a new line of text.

Note: Call `print('\n')` to print a blank line. Calling `print()` without
an argument opens the browser's dialog for printing documents.

## Examples
