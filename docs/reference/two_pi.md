TWO_PI is the mathematical constant 2*π. It's useful for many tasks that involve rotation and oscillation. For example, calling `rotate(TWO_PI)` rotates the coordinate system `TWO_PI` radians, which is a complete turn (360 degrees).

Note: `TWO_PI` radians equals 360 degrees, `PI` radians equals 180 degrees, `HALF_PI` radians equals 90 degrees.
