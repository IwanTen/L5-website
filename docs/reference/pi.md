A number constant that's approximately 3.1416.

PI is the mathematical constant π. It's useful for many tasks that involve rotation and oscillation. For example, calling `rotate(PI)` rotates the coordinate system `PI` radians, which is a half turn (180 degrees).

Note: `TWO_PI` radians equals 360 degrees, `PI` radians equals 180 degrees, `HALF_PI` radians equals 90 degrees.
