HALF_PI is the mathematical constant π/2. It's useful for many tasks that involve rotation and oscillation. For example, calling `rotate(HALF_PI)` rotates the coordinate system `HALF_PI` radians, which is a quarter turn (90 degrees).

Note: `TWO_PI` radians equals 360 degrees, `PI` radians equals 180 degrees, `HALF_PI` radians equals 90 degrees.
