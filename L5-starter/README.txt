# Welcome to L5

This is an example L5 project containing the L5.lua library and a starter main.lua file.

In order to use L5 and run your software you must have Love2d installed on your computer. Refer to the https://L5lua.org/download page or https://L5lua.org/tutorials for more information on installing Love2d on your machine. 

You do not need to edit L5.lua but it must be in your project folder. It is extensively commented, so you should feel welcome to read the source code.

main.lua is the name of your own program code. We've started you with a couple basic lines. At the top is 'require("L5")', which tells your program to use the L5 library. Following that are setup() and draw() functions you can complete.
