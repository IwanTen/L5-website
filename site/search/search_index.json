It has a straightforward easy-to-learn syntax, accessible for beginners, and it's efficient for experienced programmers as well.</p> <p>The language is lightweight and fast. Despite its small size, there are lots of libraries and it is used in everything from Minecraft's ComputerCraft, to the handheld game device Playdate and the Pico-8 fantasy console, to complex game engines and configuration languages, as well as embedded in many hardware devices. Developing in Lua means your projects can work cross-platform relatively seamlessly, enhancing accessibility and reach.</p> <p>Where Java undergoes regular major updates and JavaScript is a fast-evolving and changing language, Lua is a very slowly and intentionally developed language. It was originally created in Brazil in 1993, and still governed by a goal of including strong backward compatibility during its infrequent but focused updates. For this reason, Lua programs have a high chance of running for years, ideally with little or no changes.</p>"},{"location":"#key-features-of-l5","title":"Key Features of L5","text":"<ul> <li>Lightning fast: Scripts, images, and audio load near-instantly</li> <li>Easy syntax: Easy to learn and consistent syntax.</li> <li>Minimal footprint: L5 (~6MB, from Love2D ~4.5MB + LuaJIT ~1.5MB) vs Processing (~500MB) vs p5.js (~1-4MB + browser ~250-355MB)</li> <li>Lighter impact: Runs on older hardware and devices.</li> <li>Cross-platform: Runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, Raspberry Pi</li> <li>Synchronous execution: Code runs in predictable order, no async complexity</li> <li>Desktop-focused: Optimized for installations and standalone applications</li> <li>Resiliency: Underlying Lua language and Love2d frameworks change much slower than equivalent languages like JavaScript and Java</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#important-notes","title":"Important Notes","text":"<ul> <li>1-indexed: Lua arrays start at 1, not 0 (use <code>#</code> to get array/string length)</li> <li>2D only: Currently limited to 2D graphics (3D libraries possible but not built-in)</li> <li>Tables everywhere: Lua uses tables for arrays, objects, and data structures</li> <li>OOP patterns: Check Lua documentation for object-oriented programming approaches</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#getting-started","title":"Getting Started","text":"<ol> <li>Install Love2D from love2d.org</li> <li>Download L5 (clone the repository or download the L5.lua file to your project directory)</li> <li>Create or edit main.lua in the same directory as L5.lua</li> <li>Require L5 at the top of your main.lua file with <code>require (\"L5\")</code></li> <li>Write your program code in main.lua</li> <li>Run your program by dragging the directory holding your main.lua sketch onto Love2D icon or running <code>love .</code> in terminal from its root.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"#community-and-support","title":"Community and Support","text":"<p>While L5 is a new project with growing documentation, it benefits from:</p> <ul> <li>The welcoming Processing community and their decade+ of resources</li> <li>Extensive Processing tutorials, books, and forums that translate well to L5</li> <li>The stable Lua and Love2D ecosystems</li> <li>Active development and community contributions</li> </ul> <p>Note: As L5 is new, documentation and examples are still growing compared to the mature Processing ecosystem.</p> <p>L5 aims to make creative coding accessible, fast, and fun while leveraging the power and simplicity of Lua and a commitment to making resilient, long-lasting tools.</p>"},{"location":"L5-for-processingp5/","title":"L5 for Processing and p5.js programmers","text":"<p>L5 stands on the shoulders of Processing and p5.js.

The code is likely incorrect, and the description or parameters might be wrong!</p> <p>A way to repeat a block of code when the number of iterations is known.</p> <p><code>for</code> loops are helpful for repeating statements a certain number of times. For example, a <code>for</code> loop makes it easy to express the idea \"draw five lines\" like so:</p> <pre><code>for (let x = 10; x &lt; 100; x += 20) {\n  line(x, 25, x, 75);\n}\n`\n<p>The loop's header begins with the keyword <code>for</code>. Loops generally count up\nor count down as they repeat, or iterate. The statements in parentheses\n<code>let x = 10; x &lt; 100; x += 20</code> tell the loop how it should repeat:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>`let x = 10` tells the loop to start counting at `10` and keep track of iterations using the variable `x`.</li>\n<li>`x &lt; 100` tells the loop to count up to, but not including, `100`.</li>\n<li>`x += 20`  tells the loop to count up by `20` at the end of each iteration.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The code between the curly braces <code>{}</code> is the loop's body. Statements in the\nloop body are repeated during each iteration of the loop.</p>\n<p>It's common to create infinite loops accidentally. When this happens,\nsketches may become unresponsive and the web browser may display a warning.\nFor example, the following loop never stops iterating because it doesn't\ncount up:</p>\n<pre><code>for (let x = 10; x &lt; 100; x = 20) {\n  line(x, 25, x, 75);\n}\n`\n<p>The statement <code>x = 20</code> keeps the variable <code>x</code> stuck at <code>20</code>, which is\nalways less than <code>100</code>.</p>\n<p><code>for</code> loops can also count down:</p>\n<pre><code>for (let d = 100; d &gt; 0; d -= 10) {\n  circle(50, 50, d);\n}\n`\n<p><code>for</code> loops can also contain other loops. The following nested loop draws a\ngrid of points:</p>\n<pre><code>// Loop from left to right.\nfor (let x = 10; x &lt; 100; x += 10) {\n\n  // Loop from top to bottom.\n  for (let y = 10; y &lt; 100; y += 10) {\n    point(x, y);\n  }\n\n}\n`\n<p><code>for</code> loops are also helpful for iterating through the elements of an\narray. For example, it's common to iterate through an array that contains\ninformation about where or what to draw:</p>\n<pre><code>// Create an array of x-coordinates.\nlet xCoordinates = [20, 40, 60];\n\nfor (let i = 0; i &lt; xCoordinates.length; i += 1) {\n  // Update the element.\n  xCoordinates[i] += random(-1, 1);\n\n  // Draw a circle.\n  circle(xCoordinates[i], 50, 20);\n}\n`\n<p>If the array's values aren't modified, the <code>for...of</code> statement can\nsimplify the code. They're similar to <code>for</code> loops in Python and <code>for-each</code>\nloops in C++ and Java. The following loops have the same effect:</p>\n<pre><code>// Draw circles with a for loop.\nlet xCoordinates = [20, 40, 60];\n\nfor (let i = 0; i &lt; xCoordinates.length; i += 1) {\n  circle(xCoordinates[i], 50, 20);\n}\n`\n<pre><code>// Draw circles with a for...of statement.\nlet xCoordinates = [20, 40, 60];\n\nfor (let x of xCoordinates) {\n  circle(x, 50, 20);\n}\n`\n<p>In the code snippets above, the variables <code>i</code> and <code>x</code> have different roles.</p>\n<p>In the first snippet, <code>i</code> counts from <code>0</code> up to <code>2</code>, which is one less than\n<code>xCoordinates.length</code>. <code>i</code> is used to access the element in <code>xCoordinates</code>\nat index <code>i</code>.</p>\n<p>In the second code snippet, <code>x</code> isn't keeping track of the loop's progress\nor an index. During each iteration, <code>x</code> contains the next element of\n<code>xCoordinates</code>. <code>x</code> starts from the beginning of <code>xCoordinates</code> (<code>20</code>) and\nupdates its value to <code>40</code> and then <code>60</code> during the next iterations.</p>"},{"location":"reference/for/#examples","title":"Examples","text":"<pre><code>function setup()\n  size(100, 100)\n\n  describe('Five black vertical lines on a gray background.')\nend\n\nfunction draw()\n  background(200)\n\n  -- Draw vertical lines using a loop.\n  for x=10,x &lt; 100 do\n    line(x, 25, x, 75)\n  end\nend\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"reference/for/#related","title":"Related","text":"<ul>\n<li>rect()</li>\n<li>ellipse()</li>\n</ul>"},{"location":"reference/fract/","title":"fract()","text":"<p>Note: This page was automatically ported from p5.js to L5 and hasn't yet been checked, fixed and updated.

The expression in\nparentheses <code>mouseIsPressed === true</code> is a <code>Boolean</code> expression that's\neither <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. The code between the curly braces <code>{}</code> is the if\nstatement's body. The body only runs if the <code>Boolean</code> expression is <code>true</code>.</p>\n<p>The mouseIsPressed system variable is\nalways <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>, so the code snippet above could also be written\nas follows:</p>\n<pre><code>if (mouseIsPressed) {\n  circle(mouseX, mouseY, 20);\n}\n`\n<p>An <code>if</code>-<code>else</code> statement adds a block of code that runs if the <code>Boolean</code>\nexpression is <code>false</code>.

They're like <code>if</code> statements that repeat. For example, a <code>while</code> loop makes it easy to express the idea \"draw several lines\" like so:</p> <pre><code>x = 10\n\n-- Repeat as long as x &lt; 100\nwhile x &lt; 100 do\n  line(x, 25, x, 75)\n\n  -- Increment by 20.\n  x = x + 20\nend\n</code></pre> <p>The loop's header begins with the keyword <code>while</code>. Loops generally count up or count down as they repeat, or iterate. The statement in parentheses <code>x &lt; 100</code> is a condition the loop checks each time it iterates. If the condition is <code>true</code>, the loop runs the code between the curly braces <code>{}</code>, The code between the curly braces is called the loop's body. If the condition is <code>false</code>, the body is skipped and the loop is stopped.</p> <p>It's common to create infinite loops accidentally. For example, the following loop never stops iterating because it doesn't count up:</p> <pre><code>// Declare a variable to keep track of iteration.\nlet x = 10;\n\n// Repeat as long as x &lt; 100\nwhile (x &lt; 100) {\n  line(x, 25, x, 75);\n}\n\n// This should be in the loop's body!\nx += 20;\n`\n<p>The statement <code>x += 20</code> appears after the loop's body. That means the\nvariable <code>x</code> is stuck at <code>10</code>,  which is always less than <code>100</code>.</p>\n<p><code>while</code> loops are useful when the number of iterations isn't known in\nadvance. For example, concentric circles could be drawn at random\nincrements:</p>\n<pre><code>let d = 100;\nlet minSize = 5;\n\nwhile (d &gt; minSize) {\n  circle(50, 50, d);\n  d -= random(10);\n}\n`"},{"location":"reference/while/#examples","title":"Examples","text":"<pre><code>function setup()\n  size(100, 100)\n\n  describe('Five black vertical lines on a gray background.')\nend\n\nfunction draw()\n  background(200)\n\n  -- Declare a variable to keep track of iteration.\n  local x = 10\n\n  -- Repeat as long as x &lt; 100\n  while (x &lt; 100) \n    line(x, 25, x, 75)\n\n    -- Increment by 20.\n    x += 20\n  end\nend\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"reference/while/#related","title":"Related","text":"<ul>\n<li>for</li>\n<li>if</li>\n</ul>"},{"location":"reference/width/","title":"width()","text":"<p>Note: This page was automatically ported from p5.js to L5 and hasn't yet been checked, fixed and updated.
