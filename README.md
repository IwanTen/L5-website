## How to Contribute

This is the website for the L5 documentation site, including the reference. If you'd like to start working on an existing issue, it's suggested you make an issue. In the description field of Pull Requests please include "resolves #XXXX" tagging the issue you are fixing. If the PR addresses the issue but doesn't completely resolve it (ie the issue should remain open after your PR is merged), write "addresses #XXXX".

If you discover a bug or have an idea for a new feature you'd like to add, please begin by submitting an issue so that we can discuss it.

The documentation site is built with [Material for mkdocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).

## Build and serve
